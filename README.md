# Seeker  

Catch as many snitches as possible! 

## Description  
Runner based on flappy bird mechanics. Idea of this game is that you play as Harry Potter so you are a quidditch seeker and your goal is to catch many snitches. The more the better!

## Killer feature  
Random generation of wall height and snitch position (look [here](https://github.com/ksyusha123/Seeker/blob/main/src/Random.jack)) 

## Other details  
Some base functions such as taking the remainder of division take place in [Convert](https://github.com/ksyusha123/Seeker/blob/main/src/Convert.jack) and [CustomMath](https://github.com/ksyusha123/Seeker/blob/main/src/CustomMath.jack) libraries
